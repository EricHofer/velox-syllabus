## Workshop
Build the [Margaret Hamilton Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist))
 - Open the page
 - Try to resize the browser window
 - Create a box for the:
   - Header
   - Main content
   - Sidebar
   - Footer
 - It should resize and work the same way as the original (Expect the resize of the sidebar, it can remain the same size)
 - Figure out the bigger content component blocks in the Header, Main content, Sidebar and Footer, like: Logo, Navigations, Search bar, Infobox in the content, Footer links
 - Create boxes for these content as well and roughly do the positioning
 - Fill these components with the right content
 - Start to style these components (main colors, backgrounds, paddings, borders and margins first)
